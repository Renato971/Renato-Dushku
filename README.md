# HTML Website on CPD

The codes attached are connected to make a website with **HTML and CSS**

This work was done by **Renato Dushku** only as a part of a University assigment where I had to create a website to display the different Continuous Professional Development (CPD) activities and the hours spent in each of them. A description on how they helped me improve was also added as a part of the requirements.
